  /**
    * Exercise 10 - Using DBIO composition for scheduling cat food shopping
    *
    * Maybe that's strange, but cats from our db need to eat something.
    * Let's schedule shopping of cat food for next week. Luckily, some logic needed for this task is already implemented.
    *
    * You can use following services: CheapestFoodPickerService, ShoppingScheduleService and WeatherService
    *
    * Your task is to get schedule that you can pin on your fridge, taking in account that:
    * - you got to satisfy calories needs of all cats in your DB for the whole week
    * - you should consider all cat food shops
    * - you want to go to the shop only on days with good weather
    * - you want to go to the shop on all days with good weather to not carry too much at one time
    *
    * Hint: check methods DBIO.from and EmptyOps.filterA from cats-mtl
